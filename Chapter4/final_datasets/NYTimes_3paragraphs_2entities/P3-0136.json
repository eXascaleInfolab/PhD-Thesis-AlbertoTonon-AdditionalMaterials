  "shownText":"But we are still part of earth\u2019s fauna and flora.\nContrary to general opinion, demons and gods do not vie for our allegiance.\nWe are bound to it by emotion, physiology, and not least, deep history.\nExalted we are indeed, risen to be the mind of the biosphere without a doubt, our spirits capable of awe and ever more breathtaking leaps of imagination.\nSelf-understanding is what counts for long-term survival, both for individuals and for the species.\nWe are self-made, independent, alone and fragile.\nIt is dangerous to think of this planet as a way station to a better world, or continue to convert it into a literal, human-engineered spaceship.\nWe will also, I believe, take a more serious look at our place in nature.\n\nEdward O. Wilson is Honorary Curator in Entomology and University Research Professor Emeritus, Harvard University.\nHe has received more than 100 awards for his research and writing, including the U. S.
