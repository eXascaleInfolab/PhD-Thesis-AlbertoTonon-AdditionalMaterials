  "shownText":"We instinctively delight in the telling of countless stories about others as players upon the inner stage.\nThe best of it is expressed in the creative arts, political theory, and other higher-level activities we have come to call the humanities.\nToday, at the terminus of this evolutionary process, our immense memory banks are smoothly activated across the past, present, and future.\nThey allow us to evaluate the prospects and consequences variously of alliances, bonding, sexual contact, rivalries, domination, deception, loyalty and betrayal.\nThe social intelligence of the campsite-anchored prehumans evolved as a kind of non-stop game of chess.\n\nThe expansion of the human brain was one of the most rapid episodes of evolution of complex organs in the history of life.\nThe definitive part of the long creation story evidently began with the primitive Homo habilis (or a species closely related to it) two million years ago.\nPrior to the habilines the prehumans had been animals.\nLargely vegetarians, they had human-like bodies, but their cranial capacity remained chimpanzee-size, at or below 500 cubic centimeters.\nStarting with the habiline period the capacity grew precipitously: to 680 cubic centimeters in Homo habilis, 900 in Homo erectus, and about 1,400 in Homo sapiens.\n\nAt present there are two competing theories of the principal force.\nAltruism in turn engenders complex social organization, and, in the one case that involves big mammals, human-level intelligence.\nStill, to recognize the rare coming together of cooperating primates is not enough to account for the full potential of modern humans that brain capacity provides.\nThe first is kin selection: individuals favor collateral kin (relatives other than offspring) making it easier for altruism to evolve among members of the same group.\nEvolutionary biologists have searched for the grandmaster of advanced social evolution, the combination of forces and environmental circumstances that bestowed greater longevity and more successful reproduction on the possession of high social intelligence.\n",
