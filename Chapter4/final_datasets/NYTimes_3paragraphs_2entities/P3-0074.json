  "shownText":"Like many retailers, Barnes & Nobles is dealing with waning profit in its core business, as online players and other competitors gain marketshare.\nThe company recently warned that earnings in the latest quarter would be weak, with losses rising in its Nook Media division.\n\nMr. Riggio, who owns nearly 30 percent of Barnes & Noble, plans to negotiate the price with the board, according to a regulatory filing.\nThe proposal is expected to be mainly in cash.\n\nIt is the boldest move yet by Mr. Riggio to try and save the company he built into the nation\u2019s biggest brick-and-mortar bookseller.\nHe has fended off challenges from the likes of the billionaire Ronald Burkle, arguing in large part that the company was well-positioned in the future by betting on the Nook and digital books.\n",
