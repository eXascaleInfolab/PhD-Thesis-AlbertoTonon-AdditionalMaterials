    "shownText": "Given the complexities of lung transplantation, in which transfusions are routine, some doctors felt the procedure posed unacceptable dangers.\nOthers could not get past the ethics of it all.\nWith more than 1,600 desperately ill people waiting for a donated lung, was it appropriate to give one to a woman who might needlessly sacrifice her life and the organ along with it?\n\nBy the time Ms. Tomczak found Dr. Scott A. Scheinin at The Methodist Hospital in Houston last spring, he had long since made peace with such quandaries.\nLike a number of physicians, he had become persuaded by a growing body of research that transfusions often pose unnecessary risks and should be avoided when possible, even in complicated cases.\n\nBy cherry-picking patients with low odds of complications, Dr. Scheinin felt he could operate almost as safely without blood as with it.\nThe way he saw it, patients declined lifesaving therapies all the time, for all manner of reasons, and it was not his place to deny care just because those reasons were sometimes religious or unconventional.\n",
