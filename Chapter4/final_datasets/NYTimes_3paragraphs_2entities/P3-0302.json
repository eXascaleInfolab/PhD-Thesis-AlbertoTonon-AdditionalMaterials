  "shownText":"The project has the feel of a social experiment: what if women at major corporations could review research on how to overcome gender barriers, along with instruction on skills like negotiation and communication?\nWill working women, already stretched thin, attend nighttime video lectures on \u201cUnconditional Responsibility\u201d and \u201cUsing Stories Powerfully\u201d?\nThe instructions for the gatherings, provided to The New York Times by an outside adviser to the project, are precise, down to membership requirements (participants can miss no more than two monthly meetings per year) and the format (15-minute check-in, 3 minutes each for personal updates, a 90-minute presentation, then discussion).\n\nMs. Sandberg has asked a wide array of women to contribute their success stories to her new Web site.\n(Jill Abramson, the executive editor of The Times, wrote an essay, and the newspaper is one of many corporations to sign on to the project.)\nThe written requests ask for positive endings, suggesting that tales closing with missed promotions or broken marriages are unwelcome.\nHoping to reach beyond an elite audience, Ms. Sandberg and her foundation joined forces with Cosmopolitan magazine, which is publishing a 40-page supplement to its April issue devoted to Ms. Sandberg\u2019s ideas, and plan to spread her message to community colleges, according to those involved in the project.\n\nBut criticism is also starting to build: that Ms. Sandberg places too much of the onus on women who are already struggling to fulfill impossible demands, and too little on government and employers to provide better child care, more flexible jobs and other concrete gains.\n",
