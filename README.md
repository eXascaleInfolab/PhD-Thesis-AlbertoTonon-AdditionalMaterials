- the folder `Chapter3` contains extended relevance judgments complementing the [SemSearch 2010](http://km.aifb.kit.edu/ws/semsearch10/) and [SemSearch 2011](http://km.aifb.kit.edu/ws/semsearch11/) datasets, and the raw output of the HITs used to obtain them. The folder also contains the data used to train the `Dec-List` approach described in Chapter 3 of the thesis.
